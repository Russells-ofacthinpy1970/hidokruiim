Just walked out of Black Bag and wow, my brain's like scrambled eggs but in a good way? You know when the credits roll, and you're still glued to the seat like it might somehow make the film last longer, that's me right now. Just a tangled mess of thoughts and sticky popcorn kernels on my jeans (seriously, who invented buttery popcorn without decisions? My fingers are ghosts haunting theirs own crumbs).

> The opening scene, right? Totally threw me off, like expecting a hot coffee but someone hands you a cold brew with chili flakes. The stark white hallway, eerily quiet, then BAM. That red briefcase. Was that a metaphor or just really bad taste in luggage? Either way, my back is aching cuz I couldn’t lean back without feeling that tension.

The villain though, kinda like a mix of your least favorite uncle and a snake that’s also your least favorite uncle... or something. His laugh was like nails on a chalkboard and yet, I couldn't get enough. The theater was so noisy, half thought it was the surround sound but nah, just folks losing their minds like me. That scene with the carousel, what even was that? My brain screamed 'this isn't supposed to be here' but my heart was all 'more, gimme more!'

Oh man, and when that guy... what was his name? The one with the hat, anyway, when he just turned to the camera and said that line—I freakin' forgot the darn line but trust me, it hit like a suburban dad's minivan running late to soccer practice. Download the movie so you can pause and just soak in that scene. I'll probably watch the movie again, just to detangle the spaghetti of it all.

> Remember the part where the lights flicker and it all turns into that dreamlike technicolor chaos? Kind of like falling into a washing machine filled with paint and glitter. WHY was that so satisfying?

My friend asked if I’d compare it to that other film—can’t remember the name but the one with dogs as the lead actors—which is totally dif. genre but you know, same kind of ‘what was THAT?’ vibes.  A part of me is still in that theater, lost in the seat cushions with some rogue popcorn stealth missioning its way home with me.

Okay, wrapping it up because it’s getting colder and my thumbs are freezing. Just… go see it. Or download it if someone told you or whatever. I need to understand better what the hell just melted into my mind.
